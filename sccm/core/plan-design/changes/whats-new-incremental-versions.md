# What’s new in System Center Configuration Manager incremental versions

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*




 System Center Configuration Manager uses an in-console [updates and servicing](/sccm/core/servers/manage/updates) process that makes it easy to discover and install Configuration Manager updates. This means no more service packs or cumulative update versions to track. You no longer have to search for the download of the most recent release or updates.

 Instead, to update the product to a new version of the current branch, you use the Configuration Manager console to find and then [install in-console updates](../../../core/servers/manage/install-in-console-updates.md). A few times each year, new versions release that include product updates. Each version can also introduce new features.  

 When you install an update with new features, you can choose to use (or not use) those features in your deployment. Different update versions are identified by year and month. For example, version 1511 identifies November 2015 (the month when System Center Configuration Manager current branch was first released to manufacturing). Later updates, beginning in 2016, have version names like 1610, which indicates an update that was created in October 2016.

 These update versions are key to understanding the incremental version of your System Center Configuration Manager installation, and what features you have available to enable in your deployment.

 The initial release of System Center Configuration Manager current branch is version 1511. Since this initial release, additional updates are available. Use the following links to discover what’s new with each version that remains in support:
  - [What's new in version 1710](../../../core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-1710.md) 
  - [What's new in version 1706](../../../core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-1706.md)  
  - [What's new in version 1702](../../../core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-1702.md)
  - [What's new in version 1610](../../../core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-1610.md)


 Each update version is supported for a year after its release. It's a good idea to stay current with the most recent update version whenever possible. For more information, see [Support for System Center Configuration Manager current branch versions](../../../core/servers/manage/current-branch-versions-supported.md).
